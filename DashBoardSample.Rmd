This R Markdown code will generate an HTML dashboard titled "MTcars Dashboard" with two tabs. The first tab contains summary statistics (both as a table and descriptive statistics), and the second tab displays two visualizations: a scatter plot of MPG vs. Weight and a histogram of the MPG distribution from the `mtcars` dataset.
